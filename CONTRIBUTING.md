🛠️ Contribution Process 
1. Fork the Repository 

Start by forking the repository on GitHub. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main branch. 
2. Create a New Branch 

Always create a new branch for each contribution: 
bash
 
 
1
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
 
 

Use descriptive names like bugfix/url-parser-issue or enhancement/report-ui. 
3. Make Your Changes 

Ensure that: 

    Code follows PEP8 style
    All new features are documented
    Tests pass (if applicable)
    Logging and error handling are clean and informative
     

If you're adding new dependencies, update the README.md accordingly. 
4. Commit Your Changes 

Write clear, concise commit messages: 
 
 
1
Fix: Handle malformed URLs in link resolver
 
 

Avoid vague messages like "Update file". 
5. Push to Your Fork 

Push your changes to your forked repository: 
bash
 
 
1
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
 
 
6. Open a Pull Request 

Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request (PR). Be sure to: 

    Describe what your PR does
    Mention any issues it fixes (e.g., Fixes #12)
    Include screenshots or logs if relevant
     

Our team will review your PR as soon as possible. 
📌 Reporting Issues 

If you find a bug or have an idea for improvement, please open an issue on GitHub. 

When reporting bugs, include: 

    A clear title and description
    Steps to reproduce
    Expected vs actual behavior
    Python version and OS used
    Any relevant logs or error messages
     

For feature requests, explain: 

    The problem you're trying to solve
    How the feature would help
    Possible implementation ideas (optional)
     

🧪 Testing 

If you're modifying or adding functionality, please include tests where possible. 

We recommend using pytest for writing test cases. Place them in a /tests directory. 
📄 Coding Standards 

    Use PEP8  formatting
    Keep functions short and focused
    Use type hints where appropriate
    Write docstrings for all public modules, classes, and methods
    Avoid global variables unless necessary
    Prefer readability over clever one-liners
